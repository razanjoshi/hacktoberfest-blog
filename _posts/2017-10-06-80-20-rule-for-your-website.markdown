You want to consider to not treat every element of your website equally regarding the priority that it falls into regarding your desired results. Being said, that can sometimes be a challenge in itself. It is hard to look at our own website and be objective to it, in the end everything on your site is important, right? This iw where we need to remember again, that not every element on our website is the same nor is it equal.
Take a look at your site and establish while looking over the desires you have exactly which elements are those that fall under the 20%. These are the elements that provides the 80% of your results.

As in the second step you will need to be honest with yuorself, your expectations, and your desires at this point when objectively viewing your website and adjusting the remaining 80% of non-essential elements. Remember the more you remove from this 80%, the easier it will be to update and maintain the other 20%, as well as increase your desired targeted results.

I am sure right about now you are saying, hold on, it took me a long time to get this information put together, or maybe you paid for someone to add that special sidebar widget to your site. Not to mention they are still adding to the equation, at least by 20% they are. That is technically true, but this rule and article is based on the effectiveness of yuor website. and in the end this group of non-essential elements which equals 80% are not worthless, they are not worth much at the same time unfortunatly.
